# For this project, I downloaded chinook data base.

# I performed analytics on the data using SQLiteStudio. 
# I explored the data using the following SQL.

-- Tracks per genre:

SELECT g.Name AS Genre, 
COUNT(t.TrackId) AS NumberOfTracks
FROM chinook.Tracks t
JOIN chinook.Genres g 
ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
GROUP BY g.GenreId
ORDER BY NumberOfTracks DESC;

-- Customer purchase behavior:

SELECT c.FirstName
, c.LastName
, COUNT(i.InvoiceId) AS NumberOfPurchases
, SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSpent
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i 
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.CustomerId
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;

-- Total sales over time:

SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS Month
, SUM(Total) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName|| ' '||LastName as FullName
,CustomerId
,Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <>'USA'

-- Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName|| ' '||LastName as FullName
,Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country ='Brazil'

-- Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the 
--customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName|| ' '||c.LastName as FullName
,i.InvoiceId
,i.InvoiceDate
,c.Country
FROM chinook.customers as c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices as i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE c.Country ='Brazil'

-- Show the Employees who are Sales Agents

SELECT e.FirstName
,e.LastName
,e.Title 
FROM chinook.employees as e
WHERE e.Title LIKE '%Sales%Agent%'

-- Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as i
ORDER BY i.BillingCountry;
